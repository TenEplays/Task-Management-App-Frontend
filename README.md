# ðŸŽ¯ Task-Management-App-Frontend ðŸš€

The Task-Management-App-Frontend is a user-friendly interface designed to facilitate efficient task management. Built with modern frontend technologies, this application leverages **ReactJS** for dynamic and responsive UI components, **TailwindCSS** for a streamlined and visually appealing design, and **Node.js** for server-side rendering and tooling.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks with an intuitive interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive, ensuring usability across various devices and screen sizes.
- **ReactJS**: Interactive and reusable UI components for a seamless user experience.
- **TailwindCSS**: Customizable design system for a modern look and feel.
- **React Icons**: Scalable and customizable icons to enhance the user interface.
- **State Management**: Efficient management of application state for smooth interactions and real-time updates.

## Future Enhancements

The frontend will be integrated with a backend using **ExpressJS** to handle data operations and business logic, and **MongoDB** for persistent storage of tasks and user data.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The build is minified and optimized for the best performance. Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation.** If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` to gain full control over the configuration files. This action is irreversible.
